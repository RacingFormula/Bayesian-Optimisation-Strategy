# Bayesian Optimisation Strategy

# Overview
# This script provides a Bayesian optimisation framework that includes:
# - Suggesting the next point to sample based on the acquisition function.
# - Supporting Gaussian processes with custom kernel functions (e.g., RBF).
# - A simple interface for updating the model with new samples and their values.
# Example usage demonstrates optimisation of a custom objective function.
